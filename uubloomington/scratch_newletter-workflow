When making a post, the author selects which newsletters to publish to, and which issue to publish in
This should be a dropdown of possible issues of newsletters accepting posts.


Newsletter looks for posts whose publication has been requested, with specified pub date
Newsletter pages will be a description of the newsletter and its function, with a mechanism to subscribe/unsubscribe

Issues will be created for every publish date, managed by a recurrence.
Does django-recurrence work with Wagtail?
Issues can be proof-read at any time, to make sure expected content will be there
